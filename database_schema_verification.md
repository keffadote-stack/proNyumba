# Database Schema Implementation Verification

## Task Requirements Verification

### ✅ Three-Tier User System (Super Admin, Property Admin, Tenant)
- **Users table** created with `user_role` enum supporting all three roles
- **Employee management fields** added: `employee_id`, `hired_date`, `performance_rating`
- **Role-based access control** implemented through RLS policies

### ✅ Employee Management Tables with Performance Tracking
- **Employee Performance table** created with comprehensive KPI tracking:
  - `properties_managed`, `bookings_received`, `bookings_approved`, `bookings_completed`
  - `conversion_rate`, `average_response_time_hours`, `tenant_satisfaction_rating`
  - `revenue_generated`, `occupancy_rate`
- **Automated performance tracking** via triggers on booking requests

### ✅ Service Fee Calculation Fields and Automated Commission Processing
- **Properties table** includes:
  - `service_fee_amount` (generated column: rent_amount * 0.20)
  - `total_amount` (generated column: rent_amount * 1.20)
- **Payments table** with service fee breakdown:
  - `rent_amount`, `service_fee_amount`, `total_amount`
  - Automated calculation via `calculate_service_fee()` trigger function

### ✅ Booking Requests Table with Admin Assignment and Status Tracking
- **Booking Requests table** created with:
  - Admin assignment via `admin_id` foreign key
  - Status tracking with enum: `pending`, `approved`, `declined`, `completed`, `cancelled`
  - Comprehensive booking information and feedback system
- **Automated property statistics** updates via triggers

### ✅ Payment Processing Tables with Service Fee Breakdown
- **Payments table** with complete payment tracking:
  - Service fee breakdown fields
  - Payment gateway integration fields
  - Transaction reference and status tracking
  - Gateway response storage (JSONB)

### ✅ Enhanced Row Level Security Policies for Role-Based Access
- **Super Admin**: Full access to all tables and operations
- **Property Admin**: Access only to assigned properties and related bookings/payments
- **Tenant**: Access to available properties and own booking requests/payments
- **Recursive policy protection** implemented to prevent infinite loops

## Database Tables Created

### 1. Users Table
- Enhanced with employee management fields
- Three-tier role system (super_admin, property_admin, tenant)
- Performance rating tracking for property admins

### 2. Properties Table
- Admin assignment system
- Automated service fee calculation (20%)
- Comprehensive property information and statistics tracking

### 3. Booking Requests Table
- Admin assignment and status tracking
- Feedback and rating system
- Automated property statistics updates

### 4. Payments Table
- Service fee breakdown and tracking
- Payment gateway integration
- Automated service fee calculation

### 5. Employee Performance Table
- Monthly performance tracking per admin
- KPI calculations and conversion rates
- Revenue and occupancy tracking

### 6. Notifications Table
- Multi-channel notification support
- User-specific notification management
- Delivery and read status tracking

## Automated Functions and Triggers

### Service Fee Automation
- `calculate_service_fee()` function automatically calculates 20% service fee
- Triggered on payment insert/update operations

### Performance Tracking
- `update_employee_performance()` function tracks admin KPIs
- Triggered on booking request changes
- Automatic conversion rate calculations

### Property Statistics
- `update_property_stats()` function maintains property metrics
- Tracks inquiries, bookings, and availability status

### User Profile Creation
- `handle_new_user()` function creates user profiles automatically
- Triggered on auth.users insert operations

### Timestamp Management
- `update_updated_at_column()` function maintains updated_at timestamps
- Applied to all relevant tables

## Security Implementation

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- All tables have RLS enabled
- Role-based access policies implemented
- Recursive policy protection to prevent infinite loops

### Data Protection
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity
- Check constraints validate data ranges
- Unique constraints prevent duplicates

## Performance Optimization

### Database Indexes
- Role-based indexes on users table
- Property assignment and availability indexes
- Booking status and admin assignment indexes
- Performance tracking indexes
- Notification management indexes

### Generated Columns
- Automatic service fee calculation
- Total amount calculation
- No manual calculation required

## Verification Tests Passed

1. ✅ All tables created with correct structure
2. ✅ Service fee calculation working (20% of rent amount)
3. ✅ RLS policies properly configured for all roles
4. ✅ Triggers and functions operational
5. ✅ Employee performance tracking automated
6. ✅ Property statistics automation working
7. ✅ User profile creation automation active

## Next Steps

The enhanced database schema is now fully implemented and ready for the next task in the implementation plan. All automated systems are in place for:

- Service fee calculation and collection
- Employee performance tracking
- Property statistics management
- Role-based security enforcement
- User profile management

The database foundation supports all requirements for the NyumbaLink platform's three-tier user system with automated commission processing.
